Introduction

In this project, you’ll use Ruby to create a to-do list project you can read and write to. To do this you’ll be leaving Codecademy’s learning environment and building locally, on your own computer.

This final project builds off the skills you learned in the Ruby course. We’ll review concepts you’ve learned in the Ruby lessons on Codecademy, and also teach you a few new ones. We’ll use the command line to interact with the todo list. Command line proficiency is an important building block in your programming tool belt. Almost all programs you write will require the command line in some way.

At the end of this project, you can expect to come out with a to-do list program you can manipulate from the command line. More importantly, you’ll also have a better understanding of Ruby programming fundamentals, as well as experiencing running and manipulating files from the command line.

We’ll walk you through the steps required, but our goal is to give you the experience of building. The project will be (and should be!) challenging. At times, you might get really frustrated. If you feel stuck or confused, review the Ruby course or reach out to an advisor any time.

This final project is different from the other work you’ve done on Codecademy in two important ways:

You’ll build locally, from your computer, instead of on Codecademy.

We’ll provide instruction, but also encourage you to come up with solution on your own.

We’ve compiled resources to help you navigate through the steps involved, but expect you’ll need to do research as well to supplement what’s provided here. Good research, much like the ability to build from scratch, is an essential skill of a good developer, and a day-to-day part of the job for any working engineer. You’ll be learning as much about how to solve your own problems as you will about Ruby – and that’s a good thing!

This project starts with a list of requirements (in the form of user stories) that will help you structure your to-do list. We’ll then walk you through set-up (explaining what tools you need, and how to configure them), before teaching a few new key skills. From there, we’ll help you plan the specifics of your to-do list interactions, and give you a few tips on how to implement them.

As with any part of Codecademy Pro, feel free to reach out to the advisors at any time if you have any questions. Though you won’t be building on Codecademy, advisors are here to help.


What Are User Stories?

User stories are descriptions from the perspective of the end-user meant to capture the essence of a program’s features. In the case of your todo list, the end-user is whoever is making a list of todo items.

User stories are usually in the first-person point of view, or in other words, “I” statements. For example, “As a user, I can make todo list items, and then delete items as I complete them.”

Approaching features and bugs from the user’s point-of-view will help you create features that have a positive impact on the end-user.


Ruby Todo List User Stories

We’ve broken the Todo List user stories into three categories. The "Primary" user stories describe the core features of a real world todo list. This project guide will provide support for these in the form of instruction and code samples.

“Secondary” user stories are less fundamental to the idea of a real-world todo list. This guide provides some support for these user stories as well.

“Reach” user stories are a mix of near crucial and secondary user stories that we leave to you as a challenge once you have completed the Ruby Final Project.
