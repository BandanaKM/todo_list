Before we start designing our programs, we’re going to learn and practice a few new skills. This step is a “sandbox” because you’re encouraged to experiment and play. The more comfortable you are with these new concepts, the easier it will be to build your Todo List application.

Reading And Writing To Files

An essential skill in programming is reading and writing to files. This will play an important role in our Todo List program, since you’ll want to read an existing todo list, and then add new things to it. Learn how to read and write to files using Ruby with this article.

Using The Command Line To Get User Input

Another skill that’s important for this project is grabbing text that the user types into the command line interface, and using that to, for instance, add another todo task to your list. Learn how to capture command line text by reading this article.

Going Beyond The Sandbox

If you’ve followed the steps in the articles linked above, you’ve tested out some new ideas in Ruby, like reading and writing to files with File.open, and using ARGVto grab command line data. Now we are ready to put these tools to use.


*** EDIT: THE REFERENCE TO FILE.OPEN AND ARGV WILL HAVE TO CHANGE ***
